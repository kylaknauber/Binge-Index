# Binge Index
This is a React application which provides a user-friendly interface for searching and favoriting any movie, TV show, or person that is in the TMDB database. This application uses React Router for a robust navigation system making it simple for all users. Media data is fetched asynchronously via the TMDB web API and displayed to the user. Users can choose to sign up in order to keep track of their favorite media. Firebase Authentication enables a secure login system, with the user's favorited information stored in a Firestore database. Users can also choose to upload a profile photo which is stored via Firebase Storage. The purpose of this application was to create something which allows users to be able to find any type of media, view specific details and information on said media, and save/favorite media of their choosing.
